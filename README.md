Porject Status:
As of now, the db has been created and a copy of the scheme is on the github. It is not connected to the frontend in any way but we do have all of the tables created. 
In terms of the frontend, we have all of the pages created and some static content that is displayed. You are able to click through a series of pages and fill out forms that show feedback in the form of new content. 
We have no functioning backend.
