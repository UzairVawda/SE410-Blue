Project Status:
As of now, the db has been created and a copy of the scheme is on the github. It is not connected to the frontend in any way but we do have all of the tables created. <br/>
In terms of the frontend, we have all of the pages created and some static content that is displayed. You are able to click through a series of pages and fill out forms that show feedback in the form of new content. 
We have no functioning backend. <br/>
All of the documenation can be found under the documenation folder where we throughtly explain the user interface as well as our database application.
